Topic: Command processor
The command processor is called a shell. There are different types of shells, like Bourne
Shell sh, ash, GNU bash, ksh, zsh, csh, tcsh. You can find out what shells are available in
your system by looking into your bin directories: $ ls -l /bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin | grep ‘sh$’.
The terminal is actually a file in the system and you can use command tty to see which file
the terminal is connected to.
The command processor acts as the interface between a command. It prompts the user for a
command, reads the input, interprets the command line and creates a process to execute
the command that the operating system then runs.
