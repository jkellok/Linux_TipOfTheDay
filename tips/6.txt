Topic: File archiving
# traditional: compress, uncompress, other programs have better compression
# GNU gzip and bzip2, for individual files
## gzip can adjust compression rate 1-9, gzip -9 <file> and gzip –best <file> is the same
## bzip2 is more effective and uses similar options as gzip, like bzip2 –best <file>
# tar: tape archive, multiple files are compressed into a single package -> can’t extract single
files without decompressing the package first -> compresses better than zip
## tar -cvf archive.tar tmp/ = -c creates the archive file, -v prints verbose information, -f
specifies filename (you have to specify extension), directory tmp is compressed into
archive.tar
## -t to view contents of an archive file without extracting, -x to extract, use -C to extract the
file to a different directory, eg. tar -xvf archive.tar -C /tmp/files
# zip: every file is individually compressed, zip and unzip are separate programs
# handling compressed files, zcmp to compare files, zcat to print compressed file, zdiff to
compare with diff, zgrep to search with regular expressions
