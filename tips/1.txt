Topic: Linux operating system

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating system based on Linux kernel. Kernel
handles systemâ€™s resources and devices.

Main objective of Unix was to create an environment that is consistent across different
hardware configurations -> portable operating system. OS is insulated from special features
of hardware to minimize porting requirements -> Linux assumes the hardware is very simple
-> computer consists of process and data.

There are multiple Linux distributions, which include the Linux kernel and system software
and libraries, for example Debian, Ubuntu and Red Hat. They have different major server
release cycles.
