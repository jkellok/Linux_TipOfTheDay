Topic: Globbing
You can use file globbing to match patterns in files and you can handle those files at the
same time.
Globbing meta characters:
# [] range of accepted characters like [0-9] [a-z], A bracket matches only one character. You
can write numbers 10-29 as [12][0-9]
# [!] excluded characters, [!5] would match any character that is not 5
# ? single character that is required, you could search for three letter extensions like file.???
# * any number of characters (zero or more), file*, it can expand to huge number of files
