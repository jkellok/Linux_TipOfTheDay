Topic: Bash configuration files
# /etc/profile = global profile file, system wide settings, executed when shell starts up.
Commands in the profile customize accounts for terminals and set environment variables
(stty, umask, PATH, TZ time zone, LC_ALL language locale, message of day)
# ~/.bash_{profile,login} or ~/.profile = shell reads personal profile file after global one
# $HOME/.bash_profile = Bash only, at user log in, if file doesnâ€™t exist, reads ~/.profile
instead, changes will only take effect when user logs out and in again
# $HOME/.bashrc = Bash only, contents are executed when a new subshell is started, alias
and user function definitions, changes will take effect when the file is re-read into the current
environment with . ~/.bashrc
# $HOME/.bash_logout = Bash only, executed when user log outs, usually does not exist but
can be used to delete temporary files and write log out information
